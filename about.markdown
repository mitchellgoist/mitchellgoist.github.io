I'm a data scientist with extensive experience in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing. I defended my Ph.D. in Political Science, with a minor in Social Data Analytics, in November 2019. I'm passionate about working with a variety of tools to extract insights from messy, unstructured, real-world data. I have worked with a variety of methodologies and in a variety of settings achieve this goal, whether that is building unsupervised learning models for multi-lingual text or designing experiments and assessing causal interventions in East Africa.

As a member of the Quantitative Social Science Institute at Penn State, I was able to thrive in a multi-disciplinary environment, working alongside colleagues from Physics, Statistics, and Computer Science. I also honed my communication skills through teaching, from Introductory Statistics courses at the undergraduate level to high-level seminars on Machine Learning and various topics in NLP. I have found that the models we build as data scientists must be accompanied by clear communication, particularly to non-technical audiences, about both what models can tell us about the world, but also about their uncertainty and limitations.

I'm an avid trail runner, hiker, and backpacker. If I'm not at work or outdoors, I'm probably in my basement working on a woodworking project or engaged in some other "creative destruction" around the house. I have just relocated to the St. Louis area and am looking to learn about all the exciting projects going on in the data science community here.
