Due to its infancy as its own discipline, and the heterogeneous disciplines who contribute to it, data science can be unnecessarily confusing. It doesn't have to be so complicated. From teaching introductory statistics to social science students at Penn State, to talks on machine learning at University of Washington's eScience Instiute, I've tried to demistify this subject. To me, it all comes down to Pedro Domingues's quote: "If human beings could see in multiple dimensions, we wouldn't need machine learning." Data science is the art and science of reducing massive, unstructured, multi-dimensional data to a small range of insightful and actionable statistics.

## Taking Data Seriously in the Design of Data Science Projects

This is a chapter in the upcoming  SAGE Handbook of Research Methods in Political Science and International Relations, written alongside Burt Monroe. We focus on the practical realities of working with unstructured, social data, covering data storage, data wrangling, database management, and feature engineering. The manuscript is currently forthcoming; please contact me if you would like a copy.

## An Intuitive Introduction to Machine Learning

A short seminar delivered at the eScience Institute in July 2017. While there are tons of tutorials on the specific implementation of certain machine learning algorithms, there is less tailored to a big picture view for those who already have a strong grounding in statistics. A copy of the slidedeck for the talk can be found [here.](/assets/intro_to_ml.pdf)

## Quantitative Political Analysis (Introduction to Statistics)

This is a course I designed and taught in Spring 2019. Focused on social science majors, it covers the foundations of statistics, from basic probability theory to logistic regression and GLMs. Because of the wide ambit of the course and the target audience, my goal was to provide a course that would be theoretical without being rigorous, allowing students to get a basic intuition for modern statistical methods without getting bogged down in proofs. A copy of the syllabus and course materials can be found at this github repository.
