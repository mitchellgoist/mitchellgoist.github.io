## Analysis of Political Text in Multiple Languages

</p>

Along with my co-author, Burt Monroe, we design a new unsupervised learning model to extract insights from multilingual text. The result is a common geometric space where the position of word vectors across all languages has a substantively meaningful interpretation.

* All speeches in parliament (8 countries, 30 years, 3.2 million+ documents)
* Devised new "paradigmatic" embeddings
* Aligned these into a common space without word-to-word translation
* New decomposition-based method for extracting topics (shown above)
* New method for aggregating topic scores (ideological scaling shown below)
* 82% accurate party classification with completely _unsupervised_ model
* Demonstrate meaningful common geometry with party analogy task

</p>

Along with my co-authors, Ted Chen and Christopher Boylan, we developed a relation extraction algorithm to construct a network of human trafficking flows from an originally collected database of trafficking reports released by the State Department. 

* Scraped all trafficking reports since 2000 from State Department
* Developed a relation extraction pipeline through NER and supervised classification
* Automated method to move from qualitative reports to quantitative insights

</p>

Along with my co-author, Florian Kern, we designed and implemented a survey and series of behavioral economic measures to test varying levels of support for the government and traditional instiutitons in Uganda.

* Designed, implemented, and oversaw implementation of survey, including coordinating enumerators and designing a sampling strategy
* Used the "public goods game" from behavioral economics to measure willingess towards collective action
* Analyzed results with a permutation test, to avoid parametric assumptions about the sampling distribution and avoid false positives
